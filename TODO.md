### `FileInput` Documentation
- Revisit constant FileInput instances. Should be able to use them or should FileInput be a struct? (Is FileInput a struct anyway since it derives from a struct?)

### Follow Up
- Revisit the debugger symbol issue [mentioned here](https://devforums.apple.com/message/1023288#1023288).
